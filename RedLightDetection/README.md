#Red Light Detection 
Red light violation is one of the most commited crimes happening in india, but still in many cases especially in rural areas red light running is 
highly commited and is not even considered crime in many places. This has to stop and we from the team of Impact trackers are ready to anounce our lightweight image recognition model for Red light detection.
